Project Setup & Running:
Prerequisites

Install Node.js
Install postgres
Clone Repo https://github.com/MiguelLamas/to-do-app-pern-stack.git

Before starting the project, follow these steps to create project and get your server up and running:

mkdir server - starting our server
cd server
npm init - is going to keep track of all our packages inside the application
npm install express pg cors - express allows us to quickly create a server in Node.js, cors allows different domain applications to interact with each other (server will be running on localhost:5000 & React App on localhost:3000, postgres is there to connect our server with our database in order to run postgres queries)
touch index.js - require the libraries in this file, app.listen to start server, app.use to create middlewear (express, cors)
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon index - will watch index.js file, every time there's a change it will instantly restart it
npx create-react-app client - setting up client side with React
npm start - to get client side started
